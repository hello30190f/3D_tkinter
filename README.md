# A reason
The reason is a youtube video which is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrrAE2FsxtA&t=608s .
I whtched the video and then i want try same thing in tkinter.

# I want to show 3D things by using tkinter.

# Progress
I find i need to find file format to save and load 3D model.
So i search what is there and i find .obj is good to use.
I decide to use .obj format and i will make 3D model viewer in tkinter with this format.
